Create beautiful HTML recipes from markdown.

The `recipes` project was generated from the [RevoData Asset Bundle Template](https://github.com/revodatanl/revo-asset-bundle-templates) version `0.10.2`.

## Getting Started

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `make setup` | Install all prerequisites and set up development environment |
| `make clean` | Remove virtual environment, lock files, and caches |
| `make test` | Run all tests (unit and integration) |
| `make docs` | Generate project documentation |

Upon merging to `main`, the docs are automatically deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://thms317.github.io/recipes).
