## Ingredients

- 2 extra-large eggplants
- 2 garlic cloves, finely minced
- 4 tbsp tahini paste (60g)
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp salt

### For Garnish

- Olive oil
- Za'atar spice
- Fresh herbs like parsley
- Toasted pita bread

## Instructions

1. Prepare a BBQ grill with charcoal and a smoking box. Use gentle heat.

2. Make holes in the eggplant with a fork all over, especially around the larger bottom area. This will allow them to cook more evenly and help the smoke penetrate the eggplant.

3. Place the eggplant directly on the coals and close the grill. Turn eggplant every couple of minutes and let the skin char. Grill until eggplant has collapsed and feels tender on the inside, about 30 minutes.

4. Place the eggplant in a large bowl and cover tightly with foil. Let sit until cool enough to handle, about 20 minutes.

5. Save ALL the smoky liquid that collects under the eggplant in the bowl. Peel the charred skin off the eggplant and, using a knife, chop up the tender flesh. Place the eggplant in a strainer and strain for 10 minutes. Discard this liquid.

6. Place the drained eggplant in a mixing bowl. Add the tahini paste, garlic, lemon juice, salt and 1-2 tbsp of the smoky liquid reserved from the bowl.

7. Mix, taste, and adjust salt, lemon and smoke as needed.

8. Place in a shallow serving bowl, make a circular 'well' with the back of a spoon and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with your choice of Aleppo chili flakes, za'atar spice, or sumac. Sprinkle with fresh herbs.

Serve with warm pita bread.
