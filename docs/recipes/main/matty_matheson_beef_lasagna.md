## Ingredients

- 125ml canola oil
- 1.8kg ground beef
- 237ml good olive oil
- 6 cloves garlic
- 1 carrot
- 1 large onion
- 60ml tomato paste
- 1 tbsp dried red chilies
- 1 liter beef stock
- 473ml whole milk
- 3 large egg yolks
- 1 bunch flat-leaf parsley
- 1 box oven ready lasagna noodles
- 1.4kg shredded mozzarella (reserve some for topping)
- 250g Parmesan cheese, grated

## Instructions

1. Set stove top to high heat. In a large, deep cast iron or enamel pot, pour canola oil to cover the bottom. Add the ground beef in batches to brown properly. Once the bottom is browned, continue stirring until all beef is brown (not grey) and is boiling.
2. While the beef is browning, dice the garlic into a mince. Add a pinch of salt and rub your knife against it to break it down into a paste. Grate the carrot. Chop the onion into a small dice. Add the olive oil into a saucepan and sauté vegetables over medium heat until you see some caramelization (brown, but not dark brown). Once that happens, add the tomato paste and cook for another five minutes to get that raw tomato taste out.
3. Combine veggies and tomato paste to the beef. Stir and combine to make a beautiful mix. At this point, add the chili flakes and beef stock. Bring to a boil and reduce to let everything come together. This should take 15 minutes. Stir every 3-5 minutes so nothing burns.
4. Once the stock has reduced down to a thick sauce, add half of the milk. Reduce it down, then add the rest of the milk and reduce. Take off the heat and add the egg yolks. Stir in and let it emulsify into the meat. Taste and adjust for salt and pepper as necessary.
5. Dice the parsley. Heat the oven to 175°C (350°F).
6. Ladle the meat sauce onto the bottom of your 9x13 casserole dish, then lay down noodles, then another layer of meat sauce, then layer mozzarella, then noodle and so on until your dish is full. Add chopped parsley to the middle layer. For the top layer, add grated Parmesan and some reserved mozzarella.
7. Place casserole dish on a baking tray so no cheese drips over the sides and burns the bottom of the oven. Cook until golden brown on top (30-35 minutes).
8. Once golden brown, bring it to your counter and let rest for 15 minutes. Cut into squares and serve with a salad or something that will cut this meat and cheese party.

## Recipe Notes

- Brown beef in batches to avoid boiling it in its own liquid. This ensures proper browning.
- The sauce should be very thick and meaty, more meat than sauce really. If too soupy, reduce it more.
- Don't skip the resting time after baking - cutting immediately will result in a sloppy mess instead of well-defined layers.
- Original recipe calls for 3 tablespoons chili flakes, but this makes it extremely spicy. Start with 1 tablespoon and adjust to taste.
- Top layer should be mozzarella and Parmesan for better melting and appearance.
