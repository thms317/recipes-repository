## Ingredients

- 3 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 100g shiitakes, torn
- 4 garlic cloves, grated
- 1 tbsp freshly grated ginger
- 950ml chicken broth or vegetable broth
- ½ tsp ground turmeric
- ½ tsp brown sugar
- 2 tbsp low sodium soy sauce
- 1 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tbsp sambal oelek or other chili paste (optional)

- 1 can (400ml) unsweetened coconut milk, full fat
- 1 tbsp lime juice
- 255g instant ramen noodles
- chili oil
- sesame seeds
- chopped chives
- 4 boiled eggs

## Instructions

1. Grate the garlic and ginger. Tear the shiitakes into small pieces.

2. Heat 1 tbsp sesame oil in a large (cast-iron) pot over medium heat. Add shiitakes, and cook until they start to brown. Sprinkle with 1 tbsp sesame oil, season with salt and pepper, cook until crispy. Remove from pot.

3. Reduce the heat to low. Again, add 1 tbsp sesame oil, garlic and ginger. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Deglaze the pot with chicken broth, stir with a wooden spoon while scraping up the brown bits on the bottom of your pot. Bring to a boil.

4. Add turmeric, brown sugar, soy sauce and fish sauce. Stir in red curry paste and sambal. Add coconut milk and squeeze in lime juice. Turn off the heat if you do not serve right away.

5. Right before serving, bring the broth back to a boil, add ramen noodles and cook for 2 minutes.

6. Serve immediately finished off with shiitakes, sesame seeds, chives and chili oil. Top with eggs, enjoy!

## Recipe Notes

- Swap shiitakes for eggplant, tofu or ground meat like chicken
- Add some veggies to the broth, like spinach, bok choy, edamame, broccoli rabe, sugar snaps or baby corn
- Stir in some seared shrimp or leftover rotisserie chicken
- Instead of sambal oelek use your favorite chili paste, gochujang would work great here too
