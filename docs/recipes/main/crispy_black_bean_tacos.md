## Ingredients

- 2 cans (425g each) black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 tbsp olive oil, plus more for brushing tortillas
- 1 small yellow onion, diced
- 1 orange bell pepper, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp cumin
- ½ tsp dried oregano
- ½ tsp paprika
- ½ tsp salt
- 60g fresh cilantro, chopped
- 120ml salsa (medium or mild)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and bell pepper, cooking until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.
3. In a food processor, add 1 cup of the black beans, the sautéed vegetables, chili powder, cumin, oregano, paprika, and salt. Pulse until combined but still slightly chunky.
4. Add the cilantro and salsa, pulsing until just combined. Transfer to a bowl and fold in the remaining whole black beans.
5. Lightly brush each tortilla with olive oil and place oil-side down on the prepared baking sheet.
6. Spread 2-3 tablespoons of the black bean mixture on one half of each tortilla, then top with 2-3 tablespoons of shredded cheese.
7. Fold the tortillas over and press gently to seal.
8. Bake for 15-20 minutes until crispy and golden brown in places.
9. Allow the tacos to cool for 5 minutes before serving with your favourite toppings.
