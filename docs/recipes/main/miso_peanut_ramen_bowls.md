## Ingredients

- 1 block (350-400g) extra firm tofu
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 60ml teriyaki sauce (Bachan's Japanese BBQ sauce recommended)
- 1 clove garlic, grated
- 1 tbsp red curry paste or roasted red chili paste
- 1 tbsp white miso
- 1-2 tbsp peanut butter
- 2 tbsp reduced sodium soy sauce
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 355ml water + 1 1/2 tsp Better Than Bouillon roasted chicken or vegetable base (or substitute 355ml chicken or vegetable broth)
- 400ml can full fat coconut milk
- 170g uncooked ramen noodles
- Finely sliced cucumbers
- Cilantro and/or green onion
- Chili crisp

## Instructions

1. Press tofu with paper towels to remove some of the water. Grate tofu on a box grater, on medium/large holes.
2. Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu shreds and sauté until golden and lightly crisped (usually 10-15 minutes to get some crispy/chewy texture).
3. Add the teriyaki sauce and grated garlic to the "thirsty" tofu. Sauté for another 5-10 minutes to caramelize further. Add more sauce as desired. Transfer to a separate bowl and wipe out the pan.
4. In the same pan, heat the curry paste, miso, peanut butter, soy sauce, and brown sugar until it's worked into a thick paste. Add the coconut milk and broth, and whisk until incorporated. Simmer for 5-10 minutes until slightly thickened and creamy.
5. Meanwhile, boil ramen in a separate pot for 3-4 minutes, drain, and add to sauce. Simmer 1-2 minutes until the noodles are well-coated (add more broth if you want it to be more soupy).
6. Transfer noodles into bowls, and pour a scoop of the broth over the top. Top with the tofu, herbs, and chili crisp.

## Recipe Notes

- You can use just about any type of noodles for this recipe (regular ramen, brown rice ramen, rice noodles, etc.). Suggest 170-200g of noodles for this amount of sauce. For the most consistent results, boil the noodles separately until just cooked, then drain and fold into the sauce, to avoid things getting overly thick and sticky.
- If you want to save yourself a pot to wash, you can add the ramen directly to the sauce and let it cook in there. But you'll need 475ml broth instead of 355ml, to make sure there's enough liquid to cook the noodles. This method does not work with rice ramen, only regular wheat-based ramen.
- Using Better Than Bouillon broth base dissolved into water, instead of regular broth, has a HUGE impact on the flavor. It just tastes way better. Highly recommend using this for your broth if you have it or can find it!
- This would also work with ground chicken instead of tofu.
- The noodles will absorb some of the broth as it sits in the fridge, so you can add a little water to loosen it up after reheating if you want it saucier/brothier.
