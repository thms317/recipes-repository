## Ingredients

- 1 sheet puff pastry, thawed
- 125g brie, sliced
- 100g cranberry sauce
- Handful of fresh basil
- 1 egg, whisked

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C fan bake.
2. Place a large piece of baking paper on the bench then place your sheet of puff pastry on top.
3. Take a small bowl and press it down in the centre of the pastry to make a mark.
4. Remove the bowl, then in the centre of the circle, make 4 cuts as if cutting a pizza into 8 pieces.
5. In a wreath shape, around this circle, spread the cranberry sauce. Layer up the sliced brie and basil on top of the sauce.
6. Take one piece of pastry from the centre, over the top of the filling and connect it with the edge of the wreath. Press down to seal. Repeat until the wreath is fully formed, cutting off corner pieces of pastry if necessary.
7. Brush the pastry with the whisked egg.
8. Place the wreath and baking paper on a baking tray then bake for 25 minutes or until golden and cooked through.
9. Remove from the oven and allow to rest before cutting into pieces.
